Project Overview

### Project Name

Dream Team

### Project Description

The goal of my project is to create an application that allows users-namely soccer fans-to create their own "dream team" of their favorite players, or what they think would be the best starting XI of players in the world right now. They will also be allowed to name their team.

### Code Snippet



### Change Log
Had to scale back project from a starting XI app to a player information act. Underestimated how hard it would be for me to create 11 different buttons.
