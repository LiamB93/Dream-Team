Project Overview

Project Name

Road to Qatar

Project Description

The goal of my project is to create an application that tracks players in the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) player pool in preparation for the 2022 World Cup. It will include active players who have made appearances for the USMNT, players who have not but are on the fringes of the team, as well as promising youth players. Each player will have a profile listing their playing history, stats, quick bio, etc. The app will also track the USMNT progress though the qualifying stages and will also allow the user to create their own roster that they would like to see go to the 2022 World Cup.
